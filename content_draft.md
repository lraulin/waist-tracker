#Why Waist Instead of Weight?

Simple. I don't care how much I weigh. At all. I want to be healthy, feel good, and look good. I want to be lean and muscular. Muscle weighs more than fat. Holocaust victims weigh very little. That's not what I'm going for. I want to lose fat and gain muscle. For that goal, my waistline (and shoulder girth) is a better metric than my weight (and is much easier to measure than bodyfat percentage).

#How to Slim Your Waist

My recommendation for slimming your waistline is intermittent fasting (IF). What's that you ask? It's pretty simple. Just don't eat sometimes. I know it's blasphemy to many, but no, you will not die if you skip breakfast. Your the descendant of billions of ancestors who didn't eat three times every day.

There is now a lot of good evidence that IF is a safe and effective method of weight (or rather fat) loss, with a long list of health benefits. This is not the time or place to get into all that. For now, for those who are skeptical, just take a second to think about how insane it is to think that you'll go into "starvation" mode or something if you're not shoving food down your face every couple of hours. Think about how prehistoric humans must have lived.

Now, much about their lives was less than ideal. Personally, I'm not much into the "paleo" thing... But in this case, it's relevant. Having constant access to food is not something any of our ancestors were likely to have experienced, and thus we did not evolve to need food every several hours. Now we can eat every several hours (and we have virtually unlimited access to amounts of sugar and fat most of our ancestors could never dream of), and most of us do, if not more often, and many of us are fat and slowly dying from too much too food.

Apparently there are many benefits to IF, but the greatest benefit, IMO, comes down to this: Weight loss is above all about calories in vs calories out. (Yes, not all calories are exactly equal, but unless you're taking a very disciplined and well-informed approach, chances are your attempts to eat all the right superfoods and avoid the "junk" will flounder on the rocks of simple arithmatic.)

I've heard claims that IF can lead to weight loss even if you maintain the same overall calorie intake. Whether or not you believe that (I'm not sure whether or not I do)... For the average person who is not yet anywhere close to having visible abs (but would like to), the bottom line is this: for many people, it's the easiest and most painless way to eat less food, and to keep eating less food consistently.

Unless you really pig out, if you don't start eating until the afternoon (or evening), you'll probably be eating less overal. Without even trying. If you _are_ pigging out and somehow managing to overeat in a several hour daily window... Well, don't. Figure out what the problem is and fix it. Remember, IF isn't magic. Like I said, it _might_ be possible to lose weight even while eating the same amount total... But I prefer IF primarily because I find it to be the easiest and most painless way to consistently reduce my calorie intake. 

There are several approaches to IF. Some of the most popular are 24 hours once a week, 16:8 (or 18:6 or even 20:4), where you restrict your eating to an 8-hour window (basically you skip breakfast.

I've had some success with the 24-hour approach in the past. Now I'm going with 16:8. Why? It's the easiest. At least for me personally.

The biggest challenge in weight loss is behavior modification. You have to eat less, and keep doing so for many months. I think it's much easier to have a pattern that I can do every day, rather than something I have to remember to do once a week, and if I forget, or decide to postpone for some reason... It's too easy to fall off the wagon. Making it my habit to not eat immediately after waking, and waiting until at least 2pm (I'm not an early bird...find what works best for your schedule), and doing the same thing every day... That way, there's nothing to think about.
